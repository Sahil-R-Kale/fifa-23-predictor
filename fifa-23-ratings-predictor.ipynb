    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Football, the most popular sport in the world, has been revolutionised in recent times with new trends in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Over the years, the coverage and impact of analytics on the beautiful game has vastly increased, with play-by-play data recorded and studied for every player who touches a ball anywhere on the planet.
